```

## Getting Started

```{r setup}
library(unifrog)
```

1. Ensure you are connected to any required VPNs

2. Run `setupAzureCreds()`. You'll be prompted to enter the server, database, username and password. They will be securely stored in your operating system's credential manager.


3. To update credentials use `updateAzureCreds()`. This will prompt you for the fields that change.

### Getting results from Azure database.

The `getAzureResults()` function is able to query the database, so long as you are connected to the VPN. The raw `.sql`query must first be formatted using helper functions from `glue` and `readr`
